        Joanne Rowling was born on 31st July 1965 at Yate General Hospital near Bristol
        , and grew up in Gloucestershire in England and in Chepstow, Gwent, 
        in south-east Wales.

        Her father, Peter, was an aircraft engineer at the Rolls Royce factory in Bristol 
        and her mother, Anne, was a science technician in the Chemistry department at Wyedean Comprehensive,
        where Jo herself went to school. 
        Anne was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when Jo was a teenager and died in 1990,
        before the Harry Potter books were published.  Jo also has a younger sister, Di.

        The young Jo grew up surrounded by books. “I lived for books, she has said.
        “I was your basic common-or-garden bookworm,
        complete with freckles and National Health spectacles.”
